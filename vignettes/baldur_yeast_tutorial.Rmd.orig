# 1. Setup
This tutorial is quite fast and on a very simple data set (2 conditions only), for a more complicated tutorial on the setup please see `vignette('baldur_ups_tutorial')`.
First we load `baldur` and setup the model dependent variables we need, then normalize the data and add the mean-variance trends.
```{r setup}
library(baldur)
# Setup design matrix
yeast_design <- model.matrix(~0+factor(rep(1:2, each = 3)))
colnames(yeast_design) <- paste0('ng', c(50, 100))
# Compare the first and second column of the design matrix
# with the following contrast matrix
yeast_contrast <- matrix(c(-1, 1), nrow = 2)

# Set id column
id_col <- colnames(yeast)[1] # "identifier"

# Since baldur itself does not deal with missing data we remove the
# rows that have missing values for the purpose of the tutorial.
# Else, one would replace the filtering step with imputation but that is outside
# the scope of baldur
yeast_norm <- yeast %>%
  # Remove missing data
  tidyr::drop_na() %>%
  # Normalize data (this might already have been done if imputation was performed)
  psrn(id_col) %>%
  # Add mean-variance trends
  calculate_mean_sd_trends(yeast_design)
```
Importantly, note that the column names of the design matrix are unique subsets of the names of the columns within the conditions:
```{r design}
colnames(yeast)
colnames(yeast_design)
```
This is essential for `baldur` to know which columns to use in calculations and to perform transformations.

# 2. Mean-Variance trends and Gamma Regression fitting
Next is to infer the mixture of the data and to estimate the parameters needed for `baldur`.
First we will setup the needed variables for using `baldur` without partitioning the data.
Then, partitioning and setting up `baldur` after trend-partitioning
```{r cluster}
# Fit the gamma regression
gr_model <- fit_gamma_regression(yeast_norm, sd ~ mean)
# Estimate the uncertainty
unc_gr <- estimate_uncertainty(gr_model, yeast_norm, id_col, yeast_design)
```

# 3. Run the sampling procedure
Finally we sample the posterior of each row in the data.
First we sample assuming a single trend, then using the partitioning.
```{r posterior}
# Single trend
gr_results <- gr_model %>%
  # Add hyper-priors for sigma
  estimate_gamma_hyperparameters(yeast_norm) %>%
  infer_data_and_decision_model(
    id_col,
    yeast_design,
    yeast_contrast,
    unc_gr,
    clusters = 10 # I highly recommend using parallel workers/clusters
  )               # this will greatly reduce the speed of running baldur
# The top hits then looks as follows:
gr_results %>%
  dplyr::arrange(err)
```
Here `err` is the probability of error, i.e., the two tail-density supporting the null-hypothesis, `lfc` is the estimated log$_2$-fold change, `sigma` is the common variance, and `lp` is the log-posterior.
Columns without suffix shows the mean estimate from the posterior, while the suffixes `_025`, `_50`, and `_975`, are the 2.5, 50.0, and 97.5, percentiles, respectively.
The suffixes `_eff` and `_rhat` are the diagnostic variables returned by `rstan` (please see the Stan manual for details).
In general, a larger `_eff` indicates a better sampling efficiency, and `_rhat` compares the mixing within chains against between the chains and should be smaller than 1.05.

# 4. Running Baldur with Latent Gamma Mixture Regression estimation
First we fit the LGMR model:
```{r lgmr}
yeast_lgmr <- fit_lgmr(yeast_norm, id_col, lgmr_model, cores = 5)
```

We can print the model with `print` and extract parameters of interest with `coef`:
```{r lgmr_outputs}
print(yeast_lgmr, pars = c("coef", "aux"))
# Extract the regression, alpha, and theta parameters and the NRMSE.
yeast_lgmr_coef <- coef(yeast_lgmr, pars = "all")
```
Baldur allows for two ways to plot the LGMR model, `plot_lgmr_regression`, and `plot_regression_field`.
The first plots lines of three cases of $\theta$, `0`, `0.5`, and `1`, and colors each peptide according to their infered $\theta$.
They can be plotted accordingly:
```{r plotting_lgmr_yeast, fig.show='hold', fig.width=7.2, fig.height = 7.2}
plot_lgmr_regression(yeast_lgmr)
plot_regression_field(yeast_lgmr, rng = 25)
```

We can then estimate the uncertainty similar to the GR case:
```{r lgmr_unc}
unc_lgmr <- estimate_uncertainty(yeast_lgmr, yeast_norm, id_col, yeast_design)
```

Then running the data and decision model:
```{r lgmr_results}
# Single trend
lgmr_results <- yeast_lgmr %>%
  # Add hyper-priors for sigma
  estimate_gamma_hyperparameters(yeast_norm, id_col) %>%
  infer_data_and_decision_model(
    id_col,
    yeast_design,
    yeast_contrast,
    unc_lgmr,
    clusters = 10
  )
```

# 5. Visualization of the results
`baldur` have two ways of visualizing the results 1) plotting sigma vs LFC and 2) Volcano plots.
To plot sigma against LFC we use `plot_sa`:
```{r plotting_sa_yeast, fig.show='hold', fig.width=7.2, fig.height = 7.2}
gr_results %>%
  plot_sa(
    alpha = .05, # Level of significance
    lfc = 1      # Add LFC lines
  )

lgmr_results %>%
  plot_sa(
    alpha = .05, # Level of significance
    lfc = 1      # Add LFC lines
  )
```

While it is hard to see with this few examples, in general a good decision is indicated by a lack of a trend between $\sigma$ and LFC.
To make a volcano plot one uses `plot_volcano` in a similar fashion to `plot_sa`:
```{r plotting_volc_yeast, fig.show='hold', fig.width=7.2, fig.height = 7.2}
gr_results %>%
  plot_volcano(
    alpha = .05, # Level of significance
    lfc = 1      # Add LFC lines
  )

lgmr_results %>%
  plot_volcano(
    alpha = .05, # Level of significance
    lfc = 1      # Add LFC lines
  )
```
