\title{The 'baldur' package.}
\description{
\code{baldur} is a Bayesian hierarchical model for statistical decision
in proteomics data. It models the mean-variance trend with the option of
two different regression models, a gamma regression or a latent gamma
mixture regression. It then the regression model as en Empirical Bayes
estimator for the prior on the variance. Further, it assumes that
each measurement has an uncertainty (increased variance) associated with it
that it also infers. Finally, it tries to estimate the posterior
distribution (by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) for the differences in means for
each peptide in the data. Once the posterior is inferred, it integrates the
tails to estimate the probability of error from which a statistical
decision can be made.
